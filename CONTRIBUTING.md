# Guidance on how to contribute

There are two primary ways to help:

-   Using the issue tracker, and
-   Changing the code-base.

## Using the issue tracker

Use the issue tracker to suggest feature requests, report bugs, and ask questions.
This is also a great way to connect with me as well as others who are interested in this solution.

Use the issue tracker to find ways to contribute. Find a bug or a feature, mention in
the issue that you will take on that effort, then follow the _Changing the code-base_
guidance below.

## Changing the code-base

Pull requests are very much welcome! If you see something you'd like to add, please do. For drastic changes, please open an issue first.

Generally speaking, you should fork this repository, make changes in your
own fork, and then submit a pull request. All new code should have associated
unit tests that validate implemented features and the presence or lack of defects.
Additionally, the code should follow any stylistic and architectural guidelines
prescribed by the project. In the absence of such guidelines, mimic the styles
and patterns in the existing code-base.

<!-- ## Browser support

We configure our build chain tools
(typically [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)
and [Babel](https://babeljs.io))
to support a reasonable set of backward compatibility with older browsers.

Please read up on
[our current browser support guidance](https://github.com/cfpb/development/blob/main/guides/browser-support.md)
and follow it when contributing to this project. -->
